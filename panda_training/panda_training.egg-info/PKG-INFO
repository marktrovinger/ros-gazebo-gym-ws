Description: # Panda_training
        
        This package contains several examples of RL training scripts that can be used together
        with the simulation and Openai gym environments of the `panda_openai_sim` package.
        
        ## How to use
        
        To use the scripts in this package, you first must build the `panda_openai_sim`
        package. Please see the [online docs](https://rickstaa.github.io/panda_openai_sim/) for
        installation and usage instructions. After you have successfully built the `panda_openai_sim` package, you can start the Panda Openai simulation using the following ROS command:
        
        ```bash
        roslaunch panda_openai_sim start.launch
        ```
        
        After the simulation is running, please install the 'panda_training' python package using
        the `pip install .` command inside the `panda_training` folder. After the python package
        is installed, you can then run any of the example training scripts that are
        contained in the `scripts` folder inside a [python3 environment](https://rickstaa.github.io/panda_openai_sim/get_started/install.html#py3-virtual-env).
