Description: ï»¿# Panda_openai_sim
        
        A ROS package that creates an Openai gym environment for the Panda Emika Franka robot.
        It contains a simulated version of the Panda robot together with a Panda gym environment
        that can be used to train RL algorithms as is done with the original
        [openai_gym robotics environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#robotics).
        
        ## Environments
        
        The panda_openai_sim package currently contains the following task environments:
        
        - **PandaPickAndPlace-v0:** Lift a block into the air.
        - **PandaPush-v0:** Push a block to a goal position.
        - **PandaReach-v0:** Move fetch to a goal position.
        - **PandaSlide-v0:** Slide a puck to a goal position.
        
        Here is a bare minimum example of getting something running. This will run an instance
        of the PandaReach-v0 environment for 1000 timesteps.
        
        ```python
        import gym
        import panda_openai_sim.envs
        env = gym.make('PandaReach-v0')
        env = gym.wrappers.FlattenObservation(env)
        env.reset()
        for _ in range(1000):
            env.step(env.action_space.sample()) # take a random action
        env.close()
        ```
        
        For this to work you must run the simulated Panda robot. After you have
        successfully build the `panda_openai_sim` ROS package and installed all the dependencies
        you can run the simulation using the following ros command:
        
        ```bash
        roslaunch panda_openai_sim start.launch
        ```
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        Please see the [docs](https://rickstaa.github.io/panda_openai_sim/) for installation
        and usage instructions.
